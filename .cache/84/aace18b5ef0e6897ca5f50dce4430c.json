It has been\n                  an exciting journey! Along the way I met my wonderful wife in Baranquilla, Colombia. Now we've decided to relocate to \n                  Dallas to enjoy a more urban life with more diversity. A Big Transition! And every dream starts with those first hard steps.   </p>\n\n                  <p> I've always wanted to work being creative and collaborative in a more technical arena, especialy in software and the web. </p>\n            <p> Beginning 6 months ago, all on my own and after some long days of drudgery, I started coding with Free Code Camp and going way beyond.\n                It's been frusturating at times, but very rewarding. It's become a commitment that keeps growing. From the H|C|JS foundation, I've\n                gone deep into learning and building more complex Apps in REACT. \n            </p>\n               <p> I look foward to getting myself out there, networking, and Aspire for Junior Web Developer Opportunities in Dallas.  </p>\n            \n                </div>\n          </div>\n        \n      </section>\n    </main>\n\n    <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"85454fe7524c38d6c79df9fc39ef5867","cacheData":{}}
