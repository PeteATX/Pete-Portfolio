                <p class="blurb">From Latin America to Forestry to coding every day hermit-style in a rural Texas country house... It has been
                  an exciting journey! Along the way I met my wonderful wife in Baranquilla, Colombia. Now we've decided to relocate to 
                  Dallas to enjoy a more urban life with more diversity. A Big Transition! And every dream starts with those first hard steps.   </p>

                  <p> I've always wanted to work being creative and collaborative in a more technical arena, especialy in software and the web. </p>
            <p> Beginning 6 months ago, all on my own and after some long days of drudgery, I started coding with Free Code Camp and going way beyond.
                It's been frusturating at times, but very rewarding. It's become a commitment that keeps growing. From the H|C|JS foundation, I've
                gone deep into learning and building more complex Apps in REACT. 
            </p>
               <p> I look foward to getting myself out there, networking, and Aspire for Junior Web Developer Opportunities in Dallas.  </p>
